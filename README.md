(list of the available files with short explanation)


Uploading the absolut raw data is at the moment due to the size not possible. Therefore, mostly treated data is uploaded until a solution is found.
It might be that within the first days/week after publication not all the data are uploaded or the scripts are not fully converted to English. This still needs to be done. All or further data can always be provided upon request.

You are encouraged to run other dispersion models to determine recovery rates with the provided data.
